### Pushing to the Repo
Due to merge conflicts we will have a seperate branch for each team of developers. Each team will uses these branches to push their code without causing merge conflicts between the teams. Below are the instructions to change branches.

The repo currently has these branches to work on:
>* front-end_start
>* front-end_play
>* front-end_end

For the following steps replace *branch_name* with your teams working branch.
If you are using git bash (command line) follow these steps to switch branches.
> If you are using a UI follow their documentation or tutorial videos to switch branches
* Find your way to the local version of the project
* Type the command `git branch -a`
* If you don't see your branch listed run `git pull`
* If you can locate your branch use the command `git checkout branch_name`
* You are now working on your team's branch. Push code like you would normally

**Important!!**
The first time you push to the branch use the command `git push -u origin branch_name`

When you are done working on your branch create a Pull Request for the code to be reviewed. This will allow me to ensure that any new code won't cause a merge conflict on the production version.
